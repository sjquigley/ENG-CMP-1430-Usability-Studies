    <h1>Did you watch <b><em>High Score</em></b> on Netflix?</h1>
    <h2>If so, then you understand how important usability studies are to product design and marketing. Every episode of <em>High Score</em> details how companies work to establish <em>who</em> their audience is, <em>what</em> they want, and <em>how</em> they might use a given product? Sometimes these questions aren't askes in this order, but at some point, the questions get asked. Remember episode 2, when Nintendo almost flopped in the USA had <em>someone</em> not been doing their UX research.</h2>

    <h1>Usability Studies are Fundamental to <b>ALL</b> Product Design</h1>

    <h2>That's right. Any user product, from durable goods to services and even their packaging, go through some kind of usability testing. In Usabilty Testing ENGCMP1430 we'll learn the basics of UX research by first thinking about user personas and scenarios, then practicing methods for conducting usability studies, and finally thinking about <em>how we might best communicate</em> our findings and data to our clients. Along the way, we'll be learning and applying theories of information design and human factors to inform our thinking.</h2>
